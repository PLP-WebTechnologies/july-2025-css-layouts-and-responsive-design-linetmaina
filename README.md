**CSS Layouts and Responsive Design

## Overview
This is my assignment for **CSS Layouts and Responsive Web Design**. In this project, I built a multi-section webpage that uses **Flexbox** and **CSS Grid** to create a flexible and responsive layout. The goal was to make the page look good on **desktop, tablet, and mobile screens** without using any CSS frameworks or libraries — just raw CSS.

## Features
- **Header & Navigation Bar:** The navigation uses Flexbox for easy alignment and spacing.
- **Main Content & Sidebar:** The main area is built with CSS Grid, giving more space to the content and a sidebar for extra info.
- **Responsive Design:** Media queries adjust the layout for smaller screens (tablets and mobiles), stacking sections and adjusting navigation.
- **Clean & Readable Code:** The CSS is organized with comments explaining the purpose of each section.

## How I Built It
1. **HTML5 Structure:** Created semantic sections — header, nav, main (content + sidebar), and footer.
2. **CSS Layouts:**
   - Flexbox for navigation links.
   - CSS Grid for the main content layout.
3. **Responsive Techniques:** 
   - Media queries for different breakpoints.
   - Relative units (`%`, `rem`) to make the layout flexible.
4. **Styling:** Used simple color schemes.
